Qix Game (Project Description)

The project involved the development of a puzzle video game named "Quix" using PyGame. The game was designed to challenge the player to capture 75% of the board while avoiding collision with the obstacles "Sparx" and "Qix." The player's progress was determined by the conditions of winning, hitting, and losing, with the objective of capturing the board and reaching the winning condition. The player would lose the game if they collided with Sparx, lost all five of their lives, or if they were trapped by a Sparx. The game was designed to test the player's strategy, reaction time, and problem-solving skills, making it a challenging and engaging gaming experience.
